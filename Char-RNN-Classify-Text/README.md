# Char RNN for Text Classification

This code has mostly been taken from [Pytorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html). I have used it for learning more about how to code a basic Character RNN for classifying the country of origin of names and is for educational purposes only.

## Usage
`python main.py`

## Requirements
Mentioned in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
